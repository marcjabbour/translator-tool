# 2. ðŸ§© Problem Statement

## **Current Gap**
Most Arabic learning tools:
- Focus on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), not Lebanese dialect  
- Rely on gamified engagement (points, streaks, etc.)  
- Donâ€™t offer transliteration-based reading and testing  
- Provide little adaptive feedback on personal weaknesses  

## **Opportunity**
Create a **personalized, non-gamified dialect learning environment** that emphasizes conversational practice, transliteration accuracy, and measurable self-improvement.
