# Epic 1: V1 MVP - Core Learning Loop

## Epic Goal
**Validate translation quality and learning flow** by delivering a complete learning experience that allows users to practice translating English dialogues to Lebanese Arabic, receive feedback, and track their progress.

## Epic Description

### Purpose
Establish the foundational learning loop for Lebanese Arabic transliteration practice, enabling users to engage with AI-generated content, test their skills, and receive immediate feedback on their translation accuracy.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Contextual Learning**: Users practice with realistic, culturally relevant dialogues
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time error detection and correction guidance
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of learning journey and improvement
- **Persistent Learning**: Cloud-based storage ensures progress is never lost

## Stories & Features

### Story 1.1: Contextual Story Generator
**Description:** AI generates short, realistic dialogues in English for translation practice
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. At least 20 scenario templates available
2. Stories are culturally relevant and appropriate for beginner level
3. Content is generated using AI with consistent quality
4. Generated content is stored for reuse and caching

### Story 1.2: Dual Translation Toggle
**Description:** Switch between English ↔ transliterated Arabic views
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Smooth toggle without screen reload
2. Maintains user's position in the content
3. Visual indicators show current language mode
4. Responsive design works on all device sizes

### Story 1.3: Interactive Test Mode
**Description:** Generate comprehension or translation questions based on dialogues
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Minimum 3 questions per lesson
2. Questions test both comprehension and translation skills
3. Multiple question types (multiple choice, translation, fill-in-blank)
4. Questions are contextually relevant to the dialogue content

### Story 1.4: Error Detection (Core)
**Description:** Identify English or transliteration mistakes in user responses
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Correctly classifies ≥ 80% test cases
2. Provides specific error categorization (vocab, spelling, grammar)
3. Offers constructive feedback and correction suggestions
4. Handles edge cases gracefully

### Story 1.5: Progress Dashboard (Basic)
**Description:** Track completed lessons and accuracy rates
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Displays trend chart showing progress over time
2. Summary card with key metrics (lessons completed, accuracy rate)
3. Visual indicators for improvement areas
4. Historical data preservation across sessions

### Story 1.6: Cloud Sync & Auth
**Description:** Save lessons and progress via user accounts
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Works across devices with seamless sync
2. Persistent storage of all user progress and preferences
3. Secure authentication and data protection
4. Offline capability with sync when reconnected

## Dependencies & Sequencing

### Critical Path
1. **Story 1.1** (Contextual Story Generator) - Foundation for all content
2. **Story 1.6** (Cloud Sync & Auth) - Required for persistent storage
3. **Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4** (Toggle, Test Mode, Error Detection) - Core interaction features
4. **Story 1.5** (Progress Dashboard) - Analytics and feedback

### External Dependencies
- Supabase/PostgreSQL database setup
- Claude AI API integration
- Authentication provider configuration

## Technical Considerations

### Core Technologies
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Python
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI Integration:** Claude for content generation, hybrid AI for evaluation
- **Frontend:** Flutter (iOS-first)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT

### Integration Points
- AI services for content generation and evaluation
- Database for persistent storage
- Authentication system for user management
- Caching layer for performance optimization

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All 6 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- Error detection accuracy ≥ 80%
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- Cross-device sync working reliably

### Business Metrics
- User engagement: Average session duration > 10 minutes
- Learning effectiveness: User accuracy improvement over time
- User retention: Daily active users returning within 7 days
- Content satisfaction: Variety and cultural relevance feedback

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
1. **AI Content Quality:** Generated dialogues may lack cultural nuance
   - *Mitigation:* Implement content review process and cultural validation
2. **Performance:** AI generation latency affecting user experience
   - *Mitigation:* Implement aggressive caching and pre-generation strategies
3. **Error Detection Accuracy:** False positives/negatives in mistake identification
   - *Mitigation:* Hybrid approach combining rule-based and AI-based detection

### Quality Gates
- Each story must pass comprehensive testing including performance benchmarks
- User acceptance testing with native Lebanese Arabic speakers
- Cross-device compatibility verification
- Security and data protection audit
