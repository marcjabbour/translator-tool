- **GRAMMAR**: tense/word order off (keep minimal in V1)
- **VOCAB**: incorrect word choice (mild)
- **OMISSION/EXTRA**: missing/added words changing meaning

**Evaluation Prompting Strategy**: [Source: architecture/5-ai-integration-layer.md]
- **Evaluation Prompt**: Classify mistakes into taxonomy; return structured JSON
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine regex heuristics with LLM judge for accuracy and performance

### Backend Architecture Specifications

**Integration Points**:
- Builds on existing ai_controller.py patterns from Story 1.1
- Uses authentication and rate limiting infrastructure from previous stories
- Integrates with quiz infrastructure from Story 1.3

### File Locations

- Add evaluation providers in `flutter_app/lib/providers/evaluation_provider.dart`
- Extend quiz result screens with detailed feedback display

### Performance Requirements
**Accuracy Target**: ≥ 80% classification accuracy for error detection
**Integration Performance**: Leverage existing caching infrastructure for LLM calls
**Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation for unusual input patterns

### Testing
