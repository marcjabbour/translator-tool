# Story 1.2: Dual Translation Toggle

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** language learner,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.1**: [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#dev-agent-record]
- Successfully implemented lesson data models with en_text and la_text fields
- FastAPI backend with JWT authentication and rate limiting is operational
- Lesson content is cached and available via GET endpoint
- PostgreSQL schema established with proper indexing for lesson retrieval

### Data Models
**Lessons Data Structure**: [Source: architecture/6-data-model-sql-supabasepostgres.md]
```sql
create table lessons (
  lesson_id uuid primary key,
  topic text,
  level text,
  en_text text not null,
  la_text text not null,           -- transliterated Lebanese Arabic
  meta jsonb,                      -- seed, constraints
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique(topic, en_text)           -- dedupe cache hint
);
```

**Content Structure**: Toggle will switch between `en_text` and `la_text` fields from lesson objects.

### Frontend Architecture Specifications
**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart) with Cupertino look & feel
- **State Management**: Riverpod (or Bloc) for toggle state
- **HTTP Client**: dio with interceptors for lesson data retrieval
- **Local Persistence**: Hive or SQLite (sqflite) for caching

**Core Screen Requirements**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- **Home / Today's Lesson Screen**: Contextual English text with toggle functionality
- **Toggle Implementation**: English ↔ transliterated Lebanese Arabic (no layout shift)

### Performance Requirements
**UX Guarantees**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- **Toggle Latency**: < 200ms (pre-render both texts, cached)
- **Pre-rendering Strategy**: Cache both language versions for instant switching
- **No Layout Shift**: Maintain consistent UI during language toggle

### File Locations
**Frontend Components**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- Create Flutter widgets in appropriate screen directory structure
- Implement toggle component as reusable widget
- State management files using Riverpod patterns

### Technical Constraints
**Local Persistence Strategy**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- Store last N lessons (content + quiz) for offline access
- Cache user preferences (dialect, difficulty, transliteration flavor)
- Maintain last answers and error highlights

### Testing

**Testing Requirements**: [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- **Mobile E2E**: Flutter integration tests for toggle, offline replay, and evaluation flow
- **Performance Testing**: Validate toggle latency < 200ms requirement
- **Responsive Testing**: Ensure toggle works across all device sizes

**Test Framework Standards**:
- Use Flutter integration testing framework
- Test toggle state persistence across app lifecycle
- Validate content position preservation during language switches
- Test accessibility features for language mode indicators
