- **Request Format**: `{ "lesson_id": "uuid" }`
- **Response Format**:
```json
{
  "quiz_id": "uuid",
  "questions": [
    { "type": "mcq", "q": "What does 'ahwe' mean?", "choices": ["tea","coffee","juice"], "answer": 1 },
    { "type": "translate", "q": "Translate to LA: 'How are you?'", "answer": "kifak?" }
  ]
}
```

**Authentication**: Uses existing JWT authentication and rate limiting from Story 1.1

### AI Integration Specifications
**LLM Routing Policy**: [Source: architecture/5-ai-integration-layer.md]
- **OpenAI**: Used for evaluative tasks including question set templating, response grading, and quiz generation

**Quiz Prompting Strategy**: [Source: architecture/5-ai-integration-layer.md]
- **Quiz Prompt**: Derive 3–6 questions with answer key & rationales; specify JSON schema
- **Question Types**: Generate mix of MCQ, short-text, translation questions
- **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure questions are directly related to lesson dialogue content

### Frontend Architecture Specifications
**Test Mode UI Requirements**: [Source: architecture/3-frontend-flutter-ios-first.md]
- **Test Mode Screen**: 3–6 questions (mix of MCQ, short-text, translation)
- **Inline Feedback**: Immediate response feedback for user answers
- **Technology Stack**: Flutter/Dart with Cupertino design and Riverpod state management

**Integration Points**:
- Lesson service from Story 1.2 for API communication
- State management patterns established in Story 1.2
- Responsive design principles from Story 1.2

### File Locations
**Backend Extensions**:
- Extend existing `app/ai_controller.py` with quiz generation methods
- Add quiz models to existing `app/models.py`
- Create quiz endpoints in `app/main.py`

**Frontend Components**:
- Create `flutter_app/lib/screens/test_mode_screen.dart`
- Add question widgets in `flutter_app/lib/widgets/questions/`
- Create quiz providers in `flutter_app/lib/providers/quiz_provider.dart`

### Performance Requirements
**Caching Strategy**: Leverage existing caching infrastructure from Story 1.1
**Latency Requirements**: Quiz generation should follow similar performance patterns as story generation

### Testing

**Testing Requirements**: [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- **Contract Tests**: Freeze quiz API JSON schemas using Pydantic + pytest
- **Prompt Tests**: Golden files for quiz prompts & question quality constraints
- **Mobile E2E**: Flutter integration tests for quiz workflow and question interactions

**Test Framework Standards**:
- Use existing pytest infrastructure from Story 1.1
- Follow Flutter testing patterns established in Story 1.2
- Validate question contextual relevance to lesson content
- Test all question types and user interaction flows

Excellent full-stack implementation demonstrating strong architectural consistency and comprehensive feature development. The quiz generation system seamlessly integrates AI-powered question creation with robust Flutter frontend components. Backend extensions to the AI controller show sophisticated prompt engineering and validation logic. Frontend implementation exhibits mature state management patterns with Riverpod and comprehensive data modeling.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation demonstrates exceptional adherence to established patterns and architectural guidelines from previous stories.
