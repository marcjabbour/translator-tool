  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table user_profile (
  user_id uuid primary key references users(user_id) on delete cascade,
  dialect text default 'lebanese',
  difficulty text default 'beginner',
  translit_style jsonb default '{}'  -- e.g., {"h": "7", "ain": "3"}
);
```

**Sync-Enabled Data Tables**:

- Extend local storage in `flutter_app/lib/storage/` for offline capabilities

### Security and Privacy Requirements
**Data Protection**: Secure authentication, encrypted local storage, GDPR compliance
**Authentication Security**: JWT token security, secure token refresh, password requirements
**Sync Security**: Encrypted data transmission, user data isolation, audit logging

### Performance Requirements
**Sync Performance**: Efficient incremental sync, background sync processing, optimized data transfer
**Offline Performance**: Fast local data access, smooth offline-to-online transitions
**Authentication Performance**: Fast login/logout, secure token validation

### Testing
