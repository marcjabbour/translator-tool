nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper JWT authentication integration, input validation, and protection against injection attacks. Graceful error handling prevents information disclosure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hybrid approach optimizes for both accuracy and speed. Comprehensive accuracy testing framework validates â‰¥80% requirement. Edge case testing confirms performance under stress."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Extensive edge case testing with graceful degradation. Robust error handling for malformed inputs, concurrent requests, and LLM failures."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with separation of heuristics and LLM judge. Comprehensive error taxonomy and extensible feedback system. Well-documented code with clear abstractions."
